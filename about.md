I am a Ph.D. candidate in theoretical physics at [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/), Qc, Canada. I am working under the
supervision of Prof. Dr. [Louis J.Dubé](https://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/index.php?id=contact) and Dr. [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/).
 A selection of my academic interests would include stochastic processes, critical phenomena, complex networks, Bayesian statistics and efficient computational methods. I am interested in complex systems in general, in understanding how they shape our lives, and how we can aspire to decipher them. I love sound mathematical arguments, but that being said, I am not afraid of crude approximations if that allows for clarity and insights.

My main research goal is to better understand **spreading processes on complex networks**. I favor simple models that are analytically tractable, upon which we can develop insights and eventually, a deep understanding of the system. One phenomenon I am actively studying is that of *localization*--the process survives almost exclusively in a subpart of the network. Random graph models, statistical inference, and the general study of dynamics on networks are also among my current research interests.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, training, and any sports or outdoor activities in general. I love
food (eating mostly), good liquor, wine, beer and *coffee*.
