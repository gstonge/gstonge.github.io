I am a Ph.D. candidate in theoretical physics at [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/), Qc, Canada. I am working under the
supervision of Prof. [Antoine Allard](https://antoineallard.github.io/) and Prof. [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/).

A selection of my academic interests would include stochastic processes, dynamical systems, critical phenomena, complex networks, Bayesian statistics and computation.
My doctoral research is mainly about developing analytical and computational methods to study **contagion processes on higher-order networks**.

I enjoy climbing, training, hiking, cooking, beer, whisky, and coffee.
