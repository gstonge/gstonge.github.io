I am a Ph.D. candidate in theoretical physics at [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/), Qc, Canada. I am working under the
supervision of Prof. Dr. [Louis J.Dubé](https://www.dynamica.phy.ulaval.ca/index.php?id=contact) and Dr. [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/).
I am **currently in Burlington** as a visiting graduate student at the University
of Vermont, in Laurent's research group. Come by and say hi!


 A selection of my academic interests would include stochastic processes, critical phenomena, complex networks, Bayesian statistics and computation. I am interested in complex systems in general, in understanding how they shape our lives, and how we can aspire to decipher them. I love sound mathematical arguments, but that being said, I am not afraid of crude approximations if that allows for clarity and insights.

My doctoral research is mainly about developping analytical and computational methods to study **binary-state stochastic processes on complex networks**. Random graph models, statistical inference, and the general study of dynamics on networks are also among my current research interests.

In my free time, I enjoy climbing, training, hiking.
