I am a Ph.D. candidate in theoretical physics at [Université Laval](https://www.ulaval.ca/), Qc, Canada. I am working under the
supervision of Prof. [Antoine Allard](https://antoineallard.github.io/) and Prof. [Laurent Hébert-Dufresne](http://laurenthebertdufresne.github.io/).

A selection of my academic interests would include stochastic processes, critical phenomena, complex networks, Bayesian statistics and computation.
My doctoral research is mainly about developping analytical and computational methods to study **contagion processes on higher-order networks**.

I enjoy climbing, training, hiking, cooking, beer, whisky, and coffee.
