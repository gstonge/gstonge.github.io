I am a Research Assistant Professor in the [Department of Physics](https://cos.northeastern.edu/physics/) at Northeastern University, a member of the [Roux Institute](https://roux.northeastern.edu/), and a core faculty at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/).

A selection of my academic interests include stochastic processes, dynamical systems, human dynamics, complex networks, Bayesian statistics and computation.
In my research, I combine these approaches to model realistic epidemic processes and social contagions.
I notably develop mathematical and computational methods to model the spatial dynamics of infectious diseases, focusing on epidemic forecasts, pandemic preparedness, and global biosurveillance.

I enjoy climbing, training, hiking, cooking, beer, whisky, and coffee.
