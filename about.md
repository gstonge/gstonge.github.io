I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate in the [MOBS Lab](https://www.mobs-lab.org/) at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/).

A selection of my academic interests would include stochastic processes, dynamical systems, critical phenomena, complex networks, Bayesian statistics and computation.
In my research, I combine these approaches to model realistic epidemic processes and social contagions.

I enjoy climbing, training, hiking, cooking, beer, whisky, and coffee.
