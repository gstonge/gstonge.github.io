I participated to the first edition of the [Complex Networks Winter Workshop](http://vermontcomplexsystems.org/events/cnww/)
(CNWW) last december. It was an amazing experience! Great talks from the invited speakers, and it was a very nice
environnement to develop new ties. Thanks to the organizers!
