Growth processes allow us to better understand many of the complex properties of
networks, which are by nature dynamic objects.
We can go further and assume a certain growth model did generate the structure,
allowing us to perform Bayesian inference on the past states of the network.
As we have already explored in a [previous study](https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.9.041056),
_temporal reconstruction_ is a very difficult task.

In this new [preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.04788), we introduce new
recursive methods to perform temporal reconstruction on trees.
We derive an exact counting technique that allows us to obtain the exact
posterior distribution for the arrival time of nodes, and a very efficient
Monte Carlo sampling scheme.
