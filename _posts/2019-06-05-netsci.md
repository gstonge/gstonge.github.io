This year I attended NetSci 2019 in Burlington. It was an amazing conference,
and I really enjoyed seeing back my friends from the Complex Systems Summer
School (CSSS 2018) and those of [CNWW 2018]({% post_url 2018-12-22-cnww %}).

I had a talk entitled **Mesoscopic localization of spreading processes on networks**.
I presented how we can extract localization regimes for simple and complex
contagions on networks using a clique-based approach.
