At my last participation to a workshop ([CNWW 2018]({% post_url 2018-12-22-cnww %})), I met some friendly folks from [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) in Boston.
They invited Charles (UL collaborator) and me to visit and work with them on a collaborative project about network reconstruction and graph distance.
It was very much fun!
